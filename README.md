# MouseHeatmap
A collection of python files for recording heatmaps of your mouse.

# How it works
You can create your heatmap by using:
`python3 mouse_heatmap.py`
the file will then ask you questions.

You can show your already existing heatmap using:
`python3 heatmap_show.py`

`fake_mouse.py` functions like the `pyautogui` module, except every action does not control your mouse, it instead just changes the numbers of a variable.
